/**
 * The guardian takes a job and guards it execution time. If the job takes too
 * long to execute will be interrupted.
 * <p>
 * Note that the guardian can only what one job at a time. Also must the
 * guardian's {@link #run()} method must be started somehow so that it can
 * perform its duties until {@link #shutdown()} is invoked. The most common
 * scenario would be to start the guardian in a separate thread.
